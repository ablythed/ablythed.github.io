                                <p class="text-body">&ldquo;What is true of the species that live together in a wood is also true of the groupings and sorts of people in a society, who are similarly in an uneasy balance of dependency and competition&rdquo; (Bateson 438). We see the phenomenon Gregory Bateson describes daily, hourly, in a way that bridges these two groups, the species in the wood and the people in the society: with cars swerving around roadkill, with branches blocking roads and bringing down power lines, with stilts built under houses to prevent flooding. On a larger scale, too, we have natural disasters like tsunamis and droughts razing cities and entire countries, and on a more minute level, weeds growing through sidewalk cracks and mosquitoes buzzing on window panes. We present ourselves with a dichotomy: nature and man; outdoors and indoors; organic and inorganic. We draw these apparent outlines to separate ourselves and our creations from the species and phenomena that threaten them through the competition Bateson describes, and we require this distinction in order to define a dependency of man on nature and vice-versa. But through this seemingly clean decomposition of the world into natural and man-made pieces, perhaps we introduce more problems than we solve.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">Bateson introduces the idea of drawing outlines to prevent what he calls a &ldquo;muddle,&rdquo; an entropic state of mixedness and chaos originating from interference that we feel compelled to &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; (8). Here, the muddle at first appears to be the mess of leaves in one&rsquo;s driveway or the wreckage of a coastal village after a hurricane, but perhaps these is a larger, more general muddle on a higher level, a muddle in the relationship between man and nature&mdash;a muddle resulting from this kind of dichotomizing. Our tendency to draw outlines like these seems to be related to our tendency to make laws; Bateson argues that this tendency arises because &ldquo;the people who make the laws wish the other people were predictable,&rdquo; and this idea seems to apply to entities other than people, too (41). The outline between man and nature appears to be a separation in the kind of laws that we believe govern the two realms we have created: documents like the Constitution and moral codes govern one group, and the laws of physics and natural selection the other. But this divide is too simplistic. Clearly humans are governed by the laws of physics and natural selection in addition to our national regulations and moral codes. These two sets of laws seem to lie on entirely different levels of governance: the legal regulations and moral codes must arise from the more fundamental and universal patterns of physics and biological evolution. In order to subsist societally under the rule of the latter, we create and follow the former. Thus, the obvious outline between human and nature ignores these multiple levels of governance, and is a poor mapping of our actual relationship to the world around us: we are a part of this world, and we affect each other in the same ways that what we call nature affects us and its other constituents. This muddling of laws seems to be a result of badly drawn outlines.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">In an attempt to explore these outlines and propose a different possible way of viewing the relationship between human and nature, I developed a two-stage participatory project, Borders. The first stage, Collection, serves as a way to recognize the inaccuracy of these outlines, and to collect information from the public about their relationship with what they perceive as nature. This information then informs the second stage of the project, Genesis, also participatory, which creates a multilayered mapping of the Collection information using dance and storytelling.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">The Collection stage should be established at a large, climbable tree in a public space and provide cards and hanging and writing materials to passersby, who are asked to write a collaborative experience they&rsquo;ve had with the organic world on a card, then choose a place in the tree to hang it, climbing up and out as far as necessary to hang the card. After a few hours, once plenty of cards have been collected, the cards should all be tied onto a rope or string in an order determined by the tree, as shown in the figure.</p>
                                <div class="d-flex justify-content-around">
                                    <img src="assets/img/tree_circle.png" width="40%" class="img-fluid"/>
                                    <img src="assets/img/tree.png" width="40%" class="img-fluid"/>
                                </div>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">The ordering of the cards will inform the structure of the Genesis stage of the project; since the order is determined by the original structure of the tree (branch placement, bifurcation, etc.), the participatory performance in the second stage is therefore also semi-determined by these characteristics of the tree. Rather than viewing this organic structure as an impediment to progress or in opposition, here it is viewed as a vehicle for expression.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">In the second stage of the project, Genesis, the string of cards is laid on in a circular form, its two ends tied together, to form a performance area and simultaneously, a projection of the tree&rsquo;s branch structure onto the two dimensional plane. An individual or group of people stands within the projection; these people will serve as the dancers, who have assigned to them a choreographic phrase; depending on the number of people and the desired complexity of the result, these phrases may been the same or different for all the dancers. Another individual or group, the storyteller(s), remains outside the project, while a third individual or group, the reader(s), is confined to the border of the circle. This individual/group reads the card nearest to them, and the individual/group outside the circle begins to tell a story based on the word, phrase, or anecdote from that card. As the storyteller spins his yarn, the dancers begin to act out their interpretation of the story using variations of their choreographic sequence. The reader selects a particular movement or phrase, and when he sees the dancers perform it, walks to the next card and reads its contents. The storyteller then shifts his story in order to accommodate the contents of the new card, and the dancers continue to perform. The story may end when the reader has completed the entire circle of cards, or alternatively, the reader may continue to reread the cards until the storyteller feels the tale is coming to an end.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">Variations on the performance can involve multiple circles of cards, perhaps overlapping, and readers walking in different directions along the circles. Most of the elements of the project can be duplicated in order to give rise to more complexity in the performance.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">The purpose of the Genesis stage is to eliminate the outlines between what we define as man and nature altogether: to develop a tri-layered coherent narrative that depends on an organic structure (here, the tree), as well as the interpretation of this and other organic structures (i.e., the material written on the cards by Collection stage participants), and finally the creative input from the storyteller, dancer, and reader based on their interpretations of the Collection participants&rsquo; interpretations of the organic world.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">When I conducted the project, only three people were available for the Genesis stage, so it was performed in the least complex way. The results, however, were still interesting. Some examples of cards created by Collection stage participants included:</span></p>

                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">During the Genesis stage, the story that was told began with the bluebirds in the yard, but quickly evolved into a more detailed, speculative stream-of-consciousness style narrative that explored the meaning of invasiveness, the belief in one or more gods, and the tendency of individuals and entire societies to reiterate the same behaviors on a large historical scale. As the story progressed, the new cards seemed to feed back into the background of the story, causing themes and motifs to emerge, and providing the entire narrative with a fairly coherent structure.</span></p>

                                                The addition of music somehow informed by the performance, perhaps based on the movements of the dancers; and

                                                Performing the Genesis stage in an outdoor setting.

                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">As I finish the project, I find myself wondering whether the erasure of these outlines is truly helpful. After all, it is true that roads cannot be easily built without cutting down trees, and ditches cannot be dug without reshaping the land. Moreover, simple mappings of relationships like the discrete, dichotomous one I have described are critical for human functioning in a complex world; without these mappings, we would be stuck in a perpetual state of trying to sort out countless intricate muddles in order to make the smallest of decisions. We might criticize the way the term nature is typically used to describe objects or structures that are not man-made, or the supposedly simplistic, primitive beauty we find in the world around us when it is stripped of technology. However, entire fields of science are still struggling to understand the form and function of this apparently primitive world, and, after all, many thoughtful people agree that we are as much a part of nature as any tree or bird; we just happened to evolve in a way that gives our species slightly more control over our structures and communities because of our motor skills and language processing capabilities. Therefore it seems that our interactions with each other are no different than the way one tree interacts with another when their roots collide, and the way we slap mosquitoes is similar to the way a vine grows up a tree, and suddenly, the term nature seems inadequate at best, as there is no nature as we use the word, but only our surroundings, behaving and forming relationships as we do, and by perpetuating its usage, we are creating a false narrative for ourselves that illustrates humans as the exception. This narrative will ultimately break down as evolution continues and either our own species or another develops into a more sophisticated form that looks upon humans as we know ourselves now like we currently see other primates or pets.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">&ldquo;You may regret that organisms have this explosive characteristic, but you may as well settle for it. The creatures that don&apos;t are out,&rdquo; Bateson writes of inter- and intraspecies competition and relations, and the same applies to human creatures (438). Our drawing of outlines between ourselves and the rest of the world, between the inorganic and organic worlds, seems to be a way of avoiding this observation, but in doing so, we are misunderstanding the way our species made it to this point, and the way it will certainly be surpassed.</span></p>
