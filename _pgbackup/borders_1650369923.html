                            <div class="me-auto ms-auto w-75">
                                <p class="text-body">&ldquo;What is true of the species that live together in a wood is also true of the groupings and sorts of people in a society, who are similarly in an uneasy balance of dependency and competition&rdquo; (Bateson 438). We see the phenomenon Gregory Bateson describes daily, hourly, in a way that bridges these two groups, the species in the wood and the people in the society: with cars swerving around roadkill, with branches blocking roads and bringing down power lines, with stilts built under houses to prevent flooding. On a larger scale, too, we have natural disasters like tsunamis and droughts razing cities and entire countries, and on a more minute level, weeds growing through sidewalk cracks and mosquitoes buzzing on window panes. We present ourselves with a dichotomy: nature and man; outdoors and indoors; organic and inorganic. We draw these apparent outlines to separate ourselves and our creations from the species and phenomena that threaten them through the competition Bateson describes, and we require this distinction in order to define a dependency of man on nature and vice-versa. But through this seemingly clean decomposition of the world into natural and man-made pieces, perhaps we introduce more problems than we solve.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">Bateson introduces the idea of drawing outlines to prevent what he calls a &ldquo;muddle,&rdquo; an entropic state of mixedness and chaos originating from interference that we feel compelled to &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; (8). Here, the muddle at first appears to be the mess of leaves in one&rsquo;s driveway or the wreckage of a coastal village after a hurricane, but perhaps these is a larger, more general muddle on a higher level, a muddle in the relationship between man and nature&mdash;a muddle resulting from this kind of dichotomizing. Our tendency to draw outlines like these seems to be related to our tendency to make laws; Bateson argues that this tendency arises because &ldquo;the people who make the laws wish the other people were predictable,&rdquo; and this idea seems to apply to entities other than people, too (41). The outline between man and nature appears to be a separation in the kind of laws that we believe govern the two realms we have created: documents like the Constitution and moral codes govern one group, and the laws of physics and natural selection the other. But this divide is too simplistic. Clearly humans are governed by the laws of physics and natural selection in addition to our national regulations and moral codes. These two sets of laws seem to lie on entirely different levels of governance: the legal regulations and moral codes must arise from the more fundamental and universal patterns of physics and biological evolution. In order to subsist societally under the rule of the latter, we create and follow the former. Thus, the obvious outline between human and nature ignores these multiple levels of governance, and is a poor mapping of our actual relationship to the world around us: we are a part of this world, and we affect each other in the same ways that what we call nature affects us and its other constituents. This muddling of laws seems to be a result of badly drawn outlines.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">In an attempt to explore these outlines and propose a different possible way of viewing the relationship between human and nature, I developed a two-stage participatory project, Borders. The first stage, Collection, serves as a way to recognize the inaccuracy of these outlines, and to collect information from the public about their relationship with what they perceive as nature. This information then informs the second stage of the project, Genesis, also participatory, which creates a multilayered mapping of the Collection information using dance and storytelling.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">The Collection stage should be established at a large, climbable tree in a public space and provide cards and hanging and writing materials to passersby, who are asked to write a collaborative experience they&rsquo;ve had with the organic world on a card, then choose a place in the tree to hang it, climbing up and out as far as necessary to hang the card. After a few hours, once plenty of cards have been collected, the cards should all be tied onto a rope or string in an order determined by the tree, as shown in the figure.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">The ordering of the cards will inform the structure of the Genesis stage of the project; since the order is determined by the original structure of the tree (branch placement, bifurcation, etc.), the participatory performance in the second stage is therefore also semi-determined by these characteristics of the tree. Rather than viewing this organic structure as an impediment to progress or in opposition, here it is viewed as a vehicle for expression.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">In the second stage of the project, Genesis, the string of cards is laid on in a circular form, its two ends tied together, to form a performance area and simultaneously, a projection of the tree&rsquo;s branch structure onto the two dimensional plane. An individual or group of people stands within the projection; these people will serve as the dancers, who have assigned to them a choreographic phrase; depending on the number of people and the desired complexity of the result, these phrases may been the same or different for all the dancers. Another individual or group, the storyteller(s), remains outside the project, while a third individual or group, the reader(s), is confined to the border of the circle. This individual/group reads the card nearest to them, and the individual/group outside the circle begins to tell a story based on the word, phrase, or anecdote from that card. As the storyteller spins his yarn, the dancers begin to act out their interpretation of the story using variations of their choreographic sequence. The reader selects a particular movement or phrase, and when he sees the dancers perform it, walks to the next card and reads its contents. The storyteller then shifts his story in order to accommodate the contents of the new card, and the dancers continue to perform. The story may end when the reader has completed the entire circle of cards, or alternatively, the reader may continue to reread the cards until the storyteller feels the tale is coming to an end.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">Variations on the performance can involve multiple circles of cards, perhaps overlapping, and readers walking in different directions along the circles. Most of the elements of the project can be duplicated in order to give rise to more complexity in the performance.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">The purpose of the Genesis stage is to eliminate the outlines between what we define as man and nature altogether: to develop a tri-layered coherent narrative that depends on an organic structure (here, the tree), as well as the interpretation of this and other organic structures (i.e., the material written on the cards by Collection stage participants), and finally the creative input from the storyteller, dancer, and reader based on their interpretations of the Collection participants&rsquo; interpretations of the organic world.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">When I conducted the project, only three people were available for the Genesis stage, so it was performed in the least complex way. The results, however, were still interesting. Some examples of cards created by Collection stage participants included:</span></p>

As the story progressed, the new cards seemed to feed back into the background of the story, causing themes and motifs to emerge, and providing the entire narrative with a fairly coherent structure.</span></p>

Upon closer inspection, I saw that all the borders of the room were slightly translucent, allowing pads of fluorescent bulbs to shine through and bathe the entire studio, which was sparsely dotted with paintings of poppies, in a strange cool glow.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">&ldquo;Do you have a bathroom?&rdquo; I asked, and she led me to it, through a well-hidden door off to the side. When I returned, she requested an entrance fee of 100 pesos, which seemed a bit steep for a less-than-clean toilet and a single room of paintings by one artist, but I obliged.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">For the sake of politeness, I decided to circle the room as slowly as I could make myself, but after the first painting, I found that I didn&rsquo;t have to feign interest. This painting showed a single enormous, smooth yellow poppy rising from a shamble of jagged grey houses, and in the background, a hot air balloon floating up and away from the whole scene. If I squinted, I could just make out two specks in the basket of the balloon that must have been its passengers. Only two of the other paintings contained visible people. They seemed instead to show different angles of one desaturated, abandoned city with a tall church spire and of course, the unsettling poppies.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">When I asked Florencia about the artist, she told me that she and her brother curated this small gallery, and that today was the final day of a two-month exhibition of the painter Alvaro Guillot celebrating what would have been his eightieth birthday. I thanked her and left, then caught the next bus back to my hotel and flew home the next day. That was it.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she says after I finish recounting our meeting in Uruguay. &ldquo;I never told you I had a brother, and anyway, that&rsquo;s not how we met. I bought a silk scarf from you for my mom at an art market in Alexandria last winter. You had a red hat, I remember.&rdquo; And she tells me that story. I recall the market, the hat, the silk scarves. I have no memory of her.</span></p>

                                <p class="text-body">It&rsquo;s not getting darker, but my eyes aren&rsquo;t adjusting. The constant tripping and heavy breathing, plus Florencia&rsquo;s beside me, are disorienting and leave me nauseated. In the tenebrous hollow among the trees we walk, all sounds seem amplified, not so that the Jungle is loud, but so that each noise, although unidentifiable, is distinguishable, clear, unambiguous. In a way, what is made invisible by the darkness is made visible again by the definition of the soundscape surrounding us. </p>
                                <p class="text-body">But this aural visibility also manages to magnify my sense of primal bump-in-the-night anxiety. I think I would rather see nothing and hear these noises less acutely than see silhouettes that seem to move almost imperceptibly accompanied by a detailed and analyzable spectrum of sounds. Every step we take, crunching twigs, scattering insects, sinking into the muddy forest floor, is an orchestral movement. Every slip of a snake somewhere in the trees is so sharp that I feel I can hear the individual scales scraping across the bark. Florencia and I hold hands in the murk of the Jungle and step synchronously, both of us understanding without saying that the more steps we take separately, the more overwhelming the noises will become. We take turns walking in front. </p>
                                <p class="text-body">I&rsquo;m leading the way when the Jungle flashes. A wall of white light blinds me, and I stagger back into Florencia, pushing both of us to the ground. In the instant that the blaze fills my entire field of vision, the inside of my head throbs, not exactly with pain, but a shooting, rhythmic sensation that erases any residual knowledge I might have had of which way is up and which way is down. The pulses of pressure are so strong that I lose all proprioception, and not just that, but control over my limbs, and I can&rsquo;t tell what parts of me are touching the ground and what parts are in the air, and I writhe without regard to my surroundings, trying to find my feet and the ground, and my breath gets lost in my chest, and my heart is pumping from all corners of my body. It feels like my body has come to a sudden halt while my brain is still traveling forward, like my consciousness itself has smashed into a wall.</p>
                                <p class="text-body">
What it really feels like is tripping over a curb in slow motion: the surprise at the instantaneous change in environment, the awareness that you&rsquo;re going to fall and it&rsquo;s going to hurt, the instinctual shooting out of the hands and protection of the head, all in all, dread realized, but all stretched out, giving me plenty of time to contemplate my own inhabitation of a currently helpless body. I have no ability to wonder about my companion, or even to worry about the crawling life forms surely creeping closer in the now-total darkness.</p>

I&rsquo;m not depressed. I&rsquo;m just saying what I mean, and I mean to have you, be you, find you. The thought of you: my trunk. If I open my eyes and look straight at the wall, and if I think of nothing but you, and if I am rooted to the ground with my trunk and bark and wood rings holding me up, and if I breathe slowly, very slowly, in and out with the tide and the moon and the pump of my heart, and if I can draw the shades down over my mind, I think I could stand on one foot forever. I think I could stand on no feet, not floating, just rooted outside my body.</p>

This is a good decomposition of being if there ever was one&mdash;breaking myself down into compounds, into particles, breathing your breath, tasting what you eat, dreaming your dreams, saying your words, becoming you, embodying you, bringing you to life.

After a while, after we rediscover the ground and gravity, we start digging. We start digging because we can&rsquo;t think of a better way to leave. Neither of us can see a thing, so walking normally is out of the question, leaving us with up and down as the only possible directions, and up means the trees and the trees mean the dangling shadowy things. So we dig.</p>
                                <p>
The only tools we have are our hands, so at first we scoop up handfuls of dirt, wet leaves, and fungi from the floor of the Jungle in a radius that seems just large enough to accommodate one of our bodies at a time. The process goes quickly enough at first, but soon we hit the roots.</p>
                                <p>
The roots of the Jungle are knotted and thick and twist together to form one colossal mat running across the entire floor of the forest. Sweat runs down onto my palms, causing my hands to slip on the already wet roots. I just can&rsquo;t seem to get a grip on anything below the first inch or two of dirt; every time I grab onto a root, it slithers away, leaving nothing but bits of residue under my fingernails.</p>
                                <p>
The sweat isn&rsquo;t just on my palms. It&rsquo;s on the back of my neck, in my hair, on the backs of my knees, even inside my ears, dripping down my face and getting in my mouth. Together, our breathing is even louder than when we were simply walking.</p>
                                <p>
Eventually I give up yanking bits of the roots away and instead stand up and turn to stomping, hoping to break them, but my feet only get tangled up. Florencia spits and coughs and cries. I cry too, maybe from the exhaustion or maybe just from the sting of sweat in my eyes.</p>
                                <p>She inhales audibly, then I can hear her crouching back to the ground, and her breathing becomes muffled as she plants her head in the dirt. After a minute, increasingly desperate, I join her, gnawing at the roots, which try to ensnare my tongue, but I yank at them with my teeth as the image of tearing at flesh and separating skin from muscle comes to mind. Before I think to spit the root out, I&rsquo;ve swallowed it, and my animal muscle memory is swallowing me, and I am becoming my teeth.</p>
                                <p>
In the moment that I center myself in my incisors, my entire body falls into line, anchored in itself, sending out a hand to rip out the roots and a knee to stay upright, and this time it works. As in a dance learned long ago, the psyche merges with the soma and the soma merges with the ground, and my thoughts and actions are indistinguishable and immediate.</p>
                                <p>
My hand pierces the bottom of the mat. Below, a ray of sun is visible.</p>
