                                <p class="text-body">Many, many Tuesdays have passed since I last saw you. Do you remember seeing me? Every day for three weeks. Or just once, glancing past, holding a door, sleeping in a park, cutting me off at a red light, letting me go in front of you in the line at the grocery store. Waving for me to cross the street first. Next to me on a plane making graphs in Spanish. Maybe I was your taxi driver.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">Doesn&rsquo;t matter now. I imagine you have forgotten me, but maybe you haven&rsquo;t.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">I have been in this class for three hours a week for nearly four months, and I only know the names of four or five of my classmates. It&rsquo;s not for a lack of trying; it&rsquo;s just that some things stick and some things don&rsquo;t. Why?</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">Surely we remember many seemingly insignificant things because they occurred at a time of great emotion. I remember some of the exact words of my grandmother&rsquo;s eulogy. I remember high school prom, passing a balloon weight, of all things, to a friend I haven&rsquo;t seen since. I remember summer camp, long ago, a counselor-in-training letting me brush her hair when the rest of the nine-year-olds left me behind for being too quiet. Miriam, you were beautiful, and I have always loved your name.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">But what about the other things? Why can I picture so vividly the flight attendant who gave me the wrong drink, then came back to correct it, five years ago, or the tall boy who sat across from me in a biology class, even longer ago than that, even though we never exchanged a single word? Why do these pieces stick, while if I try to remember a specific experience I had today, I come up empty?</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="h5 text-body">The Jungle I</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">The Jungle is dark. The mass of ropes swinging from the ceiling of limbs climbing unimaginably far above could be vines, or they could be snakes. Seems like the whole place is hissing, or that could just be the mist coiling around the greenery, the tree trunks, my legs. I haven&rsquo;t been able to tell the time of day since I entered the Jungle; the branches are too thick and grow too high to let through more than a few wandering rays of light that might be from the sun or from the moon, or from the glowing eyes of some creature many feet up in the air. I too am wandering, have been wandering for some time, and have grown accustomed to the crack of twigs and moist leaves on the ground.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">The air is too saturated with oxygen. Breathing through my skin, I feel amphibian. My body is sapping up the heavy humidity, pulling my lungs down, slowing me. I am no longer walking, but I am not quite swimming either. Hung in this place between land and water, day and night, animal and plant, I am outside my body, I am drifting through the canopy, I am burrowing through the wet of the earth, I am weaving weightlessly through the rubber trees. I don&rsquo;t know where I am, I am forgetting where I have been, and I have no sense of where I am going. Am I going anywhere?</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">I don&rsquo;t know where she came from; there was no moment of appearance, but as her form materializes gradually around me, I am unsurprised. And now we are walking through the Jungle together, and my organs grow a bit lighter as hers suck up their share of the atmosphere. I&rsquo;ve seen her before. Has she seen me before? Does a vision of me, younger and lighter, live somewhere in her memory?</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">&ldquo;How is your brother?&rdquo; I ask.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">&ldquo;How do you know I have a brother?&rdquo; she says. She steps over a root&mdash;a tumor in the ground? A tree artery? Maybe an animal, deep asleep and sinewy. The air weighs down time, too, or perhaps it&rsquo;s the time itself, hanging all around so much that I have no sense of how it passes because it cannot pass, swirling around us in hot, muggy spirals, that brings the air its gravity and settles in my alveoli.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">So maybe it&rsquo;s a long time until I respond, and maybe it&rsquo;s not. &ldquo;I think we met at a museum. There was a small exhibition in Uruguay, a long time ago, five or six years at least.&rdquo;</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">I stumbled across the gallery in the outskirts of Montevideo while looking for a public restroom after getting off at the wrong bus stop and wandering in a semi-residential area for a few hours. The eclectic, colorful, Jenga-like stacks of apartments with clothes lines running across the pedestrian-only streets lent themselves well to touristy photography, but not so much to a pit stop with something to drink and perhaps an electric fan to blow the sweat off my brow. Eventually, in desperation I knocked on the door of one of the apartments, this one painted orange with a blue and yellow door nestled under an ornate but rotting arch, and like a mirage, a woman in all black emerged in the doorway. She wore a nametag reading Florencia and, despite the seemingly nationwide lack of air conditioning and her dark attire, appeared put-together, professional, and free of perspiration.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">&ldquo;Usted está aquí para la exhibición?&rdquo;</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied hesitantly in English, and followed her into the flat, which turned out to be a studio apartment with white walls, floors, and ceiling that all seemed to emanate a gentle light. Upon closer inspection, I saw that all the borders of the room were slightly translucent, allowing pads of fluorescent bulbs to shine through and bathe the entire studio, which was sparsely dotted with paintings of poppies, in a strange cool glow.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">&ldquo;Do you have a bathroom?&rdquo; I asked, and she led me to it, through a well-hidden door off to the side. When I returned, she requested an entrance fee of 100 pesos, which seemed a bit steep for a less-than-clean toilet and a single room of paintings by one artist, but I obliged.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">For the sake of politeness, I decided to circle the room as slowly as I could make myself, but after the first painting, I found that I didn&rsquo;t have to feign interest. This painting showed a single enormous, smooth yellow poppy rising from a shamble of jagged grey houses, and in the background, a hot air balloon floating up and away from the whole scene. If I squinted, I could just make out two specks in the basket of the balloon that must have been its passengers. Only two of the other paintings contained visible people. They seemed instead to show different angles of one desaturated, abandoned city with a tall church spire and of course, the unsettling poppies.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">When I asked Florencia about the artist, she told me that she and her brother curated this small gallery, and that today was the final day of a two-month exhibition of the painter Alvaro Guillot celebrating what would have been his eightieth birthday. I thanked her and left, then caught the next bus back to my hotel and flew home the next day. That was it.</span></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she says after I finish recounting our meeting in Uruguay. &ldquo;I never told you I had a brother, and anyway, that&rsquo;s not how we met. I bought a silk scarf from you for my mom at an art market in Alexandria last winter. You had a red hat, I remember.&rdquo; And she tells me that story. I recall the market, the hat, the silk scarves. I have no memory of her.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"><p class="h5 text-body">The Jungle II</p></p>
                                <p class="text-body"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-font-sans-serif); font-size: 1rem;"><p>It&rsquo;s not getting darker, but my eyes aren&rsquo;t adjusting. The constant tripping and heavy breathing, plus Florencia&rsquo;s beside me, are disorienting and leave me nauseated. In the tenebrous hollow among the trees we walk, all sounds seem amplified, not so that the Jungle is loud, but so that each noise, although unidentifiable, is distinguishable, clear, unambiguous. In a way, what is made invisible by the darkness is made visible again by the definition of the soundscape surrounding us. </p><p>But this aural visibility also manages to magnify my sense of primal bump-in-the-night anxiety. I think I would rather see nothing and hear these noises less acutely than see silhouettes that seem to move almost imperceptibly accompanied by a detailed and analyzable spectrum of sounds. Every step we take, crunching twigs, scattering insects, sinking into the muddy forest floor, is an orchestral movement. Every slip of a snake somewhere in the trees is so sharp that I feel I can hear the individual scales scraping across the bark. Florencia and I hold hands in the murk of the Jungle and step synchronously, both of us understanding without saying that the more steps we take separately, the more overwhelming the noises will become. We take turns walking in front. </p><p>I&rsquo;m leading the way when the Jungle flashes. A wall of white light blinds me, and I stagger back into Florencia, pushing both of us to the ground. In the instant that the blaze fills my entire field of vision, the inside of my head throbs, not exactly with pain, but a shooting, rhythmic sensation that erases any residual knowledge I might have had of which way is up and which way is down. The pulses of pressure are so strong that I lose all proprioception, and not just that, but control over my limbs, and I can&rsquo;t tell what parts of me are touching the ground and what parts are in the air, and I writhe without regard to my surroundings, trying to find my feet and the ground, and my breath gets lost in my chest, and my heart is pumping from all corners of my body. It feels like my body has come to a sudden halt while my brain is still traveling forward, like my consciousness itself has smashed into a wall.</p><p>
What it really feels like is tripping over a curb in slow motion: the surprise at the instantaneous change in environment, the awareness that you&rsquo;re going to fall and it&rsquo;s going to hurt, the instinctual shooting out of the hands and protection of the head, all in all, dread realized, but all stretched out, giving me plenty of time to contemplate my own inhabitation of a currently helpless body. I have no ability to wonder about my companion, or even to worry about the crawling life forms surely creeping closer in the now-total darkness.</p><p class="h5">Letter to an Imaginary Rock in the Core of my Body</p><p>
I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m writing to, but I know it&rsquo;s within me, and I know I can&rsquo;t do anything without it. Perhaps something anchoring my insides.
Clinical: how to phrase the things I don&rsquo;t feel. I haven&rsquo;t washed my hair in weeks, but I don&rsquo;t care. I am rooted to the ground. I feel that, at least, deeply. If I stand still enough and concentrate, I can sense my own tingling root hairs and leaves, sensitive to the wind and worms.
You are just that: the ground, the earth. You are the--my--integers of living.
I&rsquo;m not depressed. I&rsquo;m just saying what I mean, and I mean to have you, be you, find you. The thought of you: my trunk. If I open my eyes and look straight at the wall, and if I think of nothing but you, and if I am rooted to the ground with my trunk and bark and wood rings holding me up, and if I breathe slowly, very slowly, in and out with the tide and the moon and the pump of my heart, and if I can draw the shades down over my mind, I think I could stand on one foot forever. I think I could stand on no feet, not floating, just rooted outside my body.
This is a good decomposition of being if there ever was one&mdash;breaking myself down into compounds, into particles, breathing your breath, tasting what you eat, dreaming your dreams, saying your words, becoming you, embodying you, bringing you to life. I am afraid to write about you because I am superstitious. I think I will write myself out of being if I write you into it. I do not know if the self I know can coexist with you.
I am inside my body and outside it. I feel in control of my heartbeat and the peristaltic movements of my digestive tract. I think of curling my toes and I curl my toes.
I wish you would come outside.
### The Jungle III
After a while, after we rediscover the ground and gravity, we start digging. We start digging because we can&rsquo;t think of a better way to leave. Neither of us can see a thing, so walking normally is out of the question, leaving us with up and down as the only possible directions, and up means the trees and the trees mean the dangling shadowy things. So we dig.
The only tools we have are our hands, so at first we scoop up handfuls of dirt, wet leaves, and fungi from the floor of the Jungle in a radius that seems just large enough to accommodate one of our bodies at a time. The process goes quickly enough at first, but soon we hit the roots.
The roots of the Jungle are knotted and thick and twist together to form one colossal mat running across the entire floor of the forest. Sweat runs down onto my palms, causing my hands to slip on the already wet roots. I just can&rsquo;t seem to get a grip on anything below the first inch or two of dirt; every time I grab onto a root, it slithers away, leaving nothing but bits of residue under my fingernails.
The sweat isn&rsquo;t just on my palms. It&rsquo;s on the back of my neck, in my hair, on the backs of my knees, even inside my ears, dripping down my face and getting in my mouth. Together, our breathing is even louder than when we were simply walking.
Eventually I give up yanking bits of the roots away and instead stand up and turn to stomping, hoping to break them, but my feet only get tangled up. Florencia spits and coughs and cries. I cry too, maybe from the exhaustion or maybe just from the sting of sweat in my eyes.
She inhales audibly, then I can hear her crouching back to the ground, and her breathing becomes muffled as she plants her head in the dirt. After a minute, increasingly desperate, I join her, gnawing at the roots, which try to ensnare my tongue, but I yank at them with my teeth as the image of tearing at flesh and separating skin from muscle comes to mind. Before I think to spit the root out, I&rsquo;ve swallowed it, and my animal muscle memory is swallowing me, and I am becoming my teeth.
In the moment that I center myself in my incisors, my entire body falls into line, anchored in itself, sending out a hand to rip out the roots and a knee to stay upright, and this time it works. As in a dance learned long ago, the psyche merges with the soma and the soma merges with the ground, and my thoughts and actions are indistinguishable and immediate.
My hand pierces the bottom of the mat. Below, a ray of sun is visible.</p></span><br></p>

                                <p class="text-body">I am personally interested in these variables because I grew up in a poor, rural county (Hyde) in eastern North Carolina with only one mainland school. Many students did not graduate from high school, and most of those who did chose to work in one of the two main industries of my county, commercial farming and fishing. The lack of academic resources in my home county correlates with its below-average literacy and numeracy scores; according to the PIAAC dataset, only 30% (resp. 27%) of Hyde County&rsquo;s population is considered proficient in terms of literacy (resp. numeracy). While the national poverty rate in 2019, according to the US Census, was 10.5%, the poverty rate in Hyde county is nearly double that, 20%. Growing up in an area with these demographics opened my eyes to the relationships among education and socioeconomic variables. I was fortunate to have parents who homeschooled me until high school, when I started to take online classes, and eventually I was able to attend college and graduate school. Most of my hometown peers didn&rsquo;t share these opportunities, so I want to use what I&rsquo;ve learned to analyze some of the factors contributing to illiteracy and poverty in my hometown.</p>

                                <p class="text-body">Through this dashboard, I found that literacy, numeracy, education, income, poverty, and health insurance coverage are all closely related. PCA with one component confirms that literacy, numeracy, and education are the top three predictors, whereas jail population rate, violent crime rate, and unemployment are less related, although the presence of outliers with respect to jail population rate has a large effect on PCA with multiple components.
Most counties in the southeastern US are business-driven and rural. The least common leading industry is Military, which leads only in Chattahoochee County, GA.</p>
