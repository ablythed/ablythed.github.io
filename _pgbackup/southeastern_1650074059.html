                                <p class="text-body">The southeastern United States has lower income, literacy, and numeracy, and higher crime rates than the national average. Though visualizations and tables exist for these variables, no centralized, intuitive visualization exists that links them. The sources that do exist are often outdated, text-heavy, incomplete, or slow. My goal in creating this D3.js dashboard was to include a variety of visualizations for users of all levels. For instance, my dashboard includes an intuitive choropleth map understandable by most users, as well as an MDS plot, which may provide valuable information for those interested in more advanced analysis. Moreover, all the components of the dashboard are interactive and linked with each other.</p>

Each data point represents a county (or in the case of Virginia, a county or county-equivalent city) with average literacy score, average numeracy score, leading employment industry, proportion of population without health insurance, unemployment rate, median household income, proportion of population with at least a four-year college degree, population total, violent crime rate, jail population rate, and proportion of the population below the national poverty line. I obtained my data from the following sources:</p>

                                <p class="text-body">I am personally interested in these variables because I grew up in a poor, rural county (Hyde) in eastern North Carolina with only one mainland school. Many students did not graduate from high school, and most of those who did chose to work in one of the two main industries of my county, commercial farming and fishing. The lack of academic resources in my home county correlates with its below-average literacy and numeracy scores; according to the PIAAC dataset, only 30% (resp. 27%) of Hyde County&rsquo;s population is considered proficient in terms of literacy (resp. numeracy). While the national poverty rate in 2019, according to the US Census, was 10.5%, the poverty rate in Hyde county is nearly double that, 20%. Growing up in an area with these demographics opened my eyes to the relationships among education and socioeconomic variables. I was fortunate to have parents who homeschooled me until high school, when I started to take online classes, and eventually I was able to attend college and graduate school. Most of my hometown peers didn&rsquo;t share these opportunities, so I want to use what I&rsquo;ve learned to analyze some of the factors contributing to illiteracy and poverty in my hometown.</p>
                                <p class="text-body"></p>
                                <p class="text-body">Through this dashboard, I found that literacy, numeracy, education, income, poverty, and health insurance coverage are all closely related. PCA with one component confirms that literacy, numeracy, and education are the top three predictors, whereas jail population rate, violent crime rate, and unemployment are less related, although the presence of outliers with respect to jail population rate has a large effect on PCA with multiple components.
Most counties in the southeastern US are business-driven and rural. The least common leading industry is Military, which leads only in Chattahoochee County, GA.</p>
